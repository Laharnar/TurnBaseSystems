ABILITY SYSTEM
1) select unit - ability wheel
2) select unit - menu - select ability
3) number system
4) Hunter x hunter weapon based. - sonny
animations and area of damage.
5) Envrounmental, like wind to makes dust, instead of tornado.
Scenes:
fantasy magic
scifi move

Chargers, charge internal magic into density based effects, like explosions, or lighting.
Consumers, Drainers. Healer that drains external energy for different effect, like heal, drain.
Ying-jang, same thing
Atom controllers, aclhemists. Produce matter on atom level, changes or moves atomic structure. Can create atomic bomb, waves, earthquakes or change material, potions. Extremly unstable and difficult to control.

Users. Instead of making stuff, they use whatever is at their disposal. It's members are usually smart and creative, with many combat options.
Detach controllers. Same as builders, but reverse. Same thing.

Tech. uses electronic components.
I don't like destroyers. It's kinda boring class. What do they do? Destroy. Better.
Consumers do the same job, detach energy stuff.

Energy users and matter users.
Collectors, Consumers, Builders, Users.

Energy system tells us what the character uses to create his abilities
Matter system tells us how he utilizes that in combat. What's his preference.

Or 2 separate system, to make 4 combinations and 4 specialists

Dead people can be used as weapons.

SHOOTING
first have gun equipped. Then press on enemy unit to shot at. then aim cone shows
hitting the line shot at enemy will do damage.(you can also make it a cone instead of line,
to hit for more damage).
Cover will reduce avaliable hit area, making it harder to hit.

BUILDER building
how about rotatable mask based build
optionally based on gathered material?

** COLLECTOR SKILLS **

ENHANCE: Enhances equipped item for few turns.
Weapon type defines effect change
Door: survivabilty against bullets
gun: insanity bullet - collector's aura gets mixed in opponets aura, which makes them lose control - reduce will?, maxmoves for n turns
stick: it becomes hard like steel which allows our soldiers to hit harder. increased damage.

Another interesting options is to to pass an enhanced item to unit with more actions, or deeper in area.
Ability counter is reduced on end of every turn, when on 0, it reverts to default weapon.


Additional: enemies cannot use enhanced weapons.

** VISION **
Let's try to devote 1 week to drawing and looking at art.
Find what sticks, try different stuff.
I would like something dark, like spies, plus agent's of shield or xcom mission vibe 
and hunterxhunter vibe freestyle combat vibe. I want a subtle touch of sci-fi cult.
maybe sonny or psycho-pass, epic battle fantasy for magic.
optionally with a touch of fun fantasy humor, maybe some slimes or something

What about the story? Setting? Military.
Rebels.
THE QUEEN CITY. Ye this one is top shit. FUCK U ALL. I'M TIRED OF YOUR SHIT.
GO FIGHT. THE WINNER BECOMES THE KING.
this has the best option on city. Craizy, like lol. dynamic. Fairy tail. FMA.
Fairy tail+ military dark magic = fma
epic battle fantasy+psycho pass = parasyte?
or re:zero/green banana guy

fma, hxh, code:geass

dynamic dark.

which one?
straight
over the top
***********************
colorful to colorless?
maybe drain abilities create a decolor effect on camera.
****************************
something with many people's focus,.

galactic? that's too big

this could be game 2, with contracts.
i should focus on the small game.
how about galactic special ops? mass effect
plus robots, and mechanical

hints; other worlds, galaxy. the world is wast and rich.
rich.

.
Alien area.
agents with powers
superheroes - no
spies
magic and soldiers
magic monsters
sci-fi
spaceships

** story **
exploration
faction/gang battles
ai
calm factions with big events happening in the city to gain influence to fight
in the queen's games.
respond on which events you go
spy through
converse ability

more of a combatless social tactical turn based?
** world building way **
core player with supporting team.
with minimal faction contact.

these revenge guys who "survived throuhg the worst"... those don't brag about it.
******************************

** map **
faction areas
those open up into faction combat area.
you can perform operations to attack factions for stuff.
if you stay stealthed you don't lose influence with them. 

optional spies or police.

event areas - open up over days, multiple even choces in multiple areas.
those open up in combat area.
when near an enemy, enter combat mode.
like your team groups up in a circle, and then fans out, still in cover.
entering fight, triggers civilians to fight too.

optional - resource focus. it earns you influence with some factions and loses it with others.
you can gain equipment, or magic stuff
loyalty - additionaly overrides the faction influence. you can do loyalty missions.
loyal soldiers don't leave you over low faction influence.

** factions **
They are sorted by recognition.



Start coming up with characters, with factions.
************
character:
2 core skills
class or specialization
*******************

Build a team - 4 people? 3? what would be the right balance?
3 is a little low for missions. depending on difficulty.
is the team core constant? 1 leading person?
or a core as a faction?
faction leader?
how about solo mission start plus deployment points?

core unit categories
in-stealth combatant
frontline
backline
optional a 1 specialist - the special fun

the flavor
enhancer
healer
distruptor
drainer
builder
charmer
multibullet
knife combatant
tactical strikes
infiltrator

core gameplay tactics
melle combat
mid range
long range
preparations - casting
conversations
stealth, infiltration

teammates
backline cleric empowerment, potions - nothing, just hands
military general or soldier, 
tactical factory robot or drone from factoy - guns and tactical laser orbital strike
little user beggar of resistance - blade, daggers
dark drain practicioner - aoe drain, deadly to allies
an empowerment tank guild member
forest warrior witch - wall detections
former pirate - close-mid range user, agile
high martial arts practicioner, like a monk - mobile, fast execution, counter
special squad soldier - gun user

specials
miner - places mines, earth animals
a slime pet infiltrator - small, enter small spaces
alchemist researcher - potions and gun, aoe attacks

i also need out of combat look.




casting, lux laser, explosion, charged homing ball, dragoon, 
aoe heal, shadow mist, shaman summon undead, call airstrike, call orbital cannon, machine gun
which is the lead? standard melle? conversionalist? eh just make the team. and how it will feel


this robot... they should have their own mind their goal. not just help, cuz why not.
different races have different values.
traitors tho
workout stuff in spaceships

Stupid robot puppies.
lmao he's "afraid" of the gun. don't give me that crap. and hurting doesn't mean disabling.

Game idea:
Fix the spaceship that was attacked. Defend against the aliens and retake the station.
The human relationship in a survirous of space crashes are interesting


*************
bad stuff
loyalty skill can be used only on the factions area - tactical progression, <no it enforces faction 
choice over free faction choice>, backstabbing(reinforces faction)
loyalty is calculates as sum of work the unit did. hard to grasp. removes the simple logic

Goal : a slightly story based game focused on characters and factions
A set of 3 skills plus  a loyalty skill and a team specific skills
loyalty it reinforce the team and the bond with specific faction.
you need to work for it it get's easier if you work for it << a new way to combine with your mates
you don't need to use it tho, it doesn't make game any easier

or it opens a new possibilty in the level for that unit - their core ability
hugely reinforces the characters

how about forcing the loyalty if you want some missions. that way you work for it AND you get 
rewarded, as part of progression

some require more loyalty? or require additional missions
reinforces faction types

*characters and factions*

goals to work towards factions - maybe cover the area?
or raise points on buildings / checkpoints
plus the global area to belong to certain faction when you win

buildings - reinforce your character's faction
objective - reinforces global goal as per quest - this is how you get teammates
end level, what to do with objective?

movement - a sense of progress through level - fight enemies

bait the enemy
zig zag over level - after defeating enemies in close area

familiarity field on units - after being in area for a while recieve a slight bonus.
reinforce factions
reinforce knowledge of units
so do enemies

to have and achieve goals
work for goals


tactics - use each character for it's goal


1 on 1 dangerous combat, supporting fast 1 shot strikes
4 on 1, 4 on 2?
1 on 3?

straight in?
easy survive?

just normal combat
surprise attacks? < long range channel attacks out of vision
hidden

we want to enforce factions
and a bit of story
characters

list a bunch of missions or events
.execute them 1 by 1
.or make a choice what to do


put out 5 main missions, over 30 days
missions can be avaliable multiple days
1 mission per day

and then there are chargo stuff and stealing

how do events trigger? hard coded story-like
side quests? sidequests too. small stories, like pirate raids

how to earn faction points?

missions are not random, but as a story and substory.
not pointless to do them in random way. you can skip the substory and just focus on main story.

what does completing missions give you? access to different characters. loyalty for team.
character personality -- some characters lose loyalty if you have them kill someone, like priest.
guessing what the characters like

politics with factions. do the mission, or sell out, to loyalty to the faction.

problem is that how do you recruit people
and how to earn faction points to recruit them
loyalty points with those factions

characters have loyalty to factions

automatic reward from story

5 factions

1 mission

5 missions

****************************
each factions has it's own story line << -----------
, which earns you loyalty.
doing all their missions gives you loyalty.
doing other's missions loses you loyalty if factions is an enemy in the story.
***************************

hiring a team memeber from that faction, earns you right to plea 
- or have 1 or 2 more chance at them, depending on faction.
If you fuck that up, you lose your teammember and their missions permanently.

do i need gold?
it's just to have more work.
to have stuff to buy.
i don't need to buy anything.

grenades or items?
it's not really necessary. just a flavor.

1 faction - 1 character. doesn't support diversity
1 fction 2 characters. why so many characters? full faction team. mixed faction team
3 would be nice. usually you want more tho.
1-3-5-7 for story, depending on on the playstyle you want. this offers player a mix of
playstyles. as in more isn't necessarily better.

1 character can be found on mission supporting the said faction and 1 when you earn right to the
faction.
earning reputation as a certain character
- gives you loyalty to characters and signifies your team mood

 more for strategy
 it can be more nyway

 7 maps
 different layouts in the city, different goals, guard numbers
 reusable city assets, night/day?

 building -> wall, windows, roof
 special faction cultural items AND from other places.

 14 characters
 some civs
 30 chars max
 that's 2 months of work... if 1 char per day

missions stacks-

 14 chars
14 loyal missions
3 per faction, 7 factions+loyality
3 anti faction + empress
7*4+3 = 32

how should the game be played
relatively easy - pull enemies, 1 shot retreat
tank, heal, disable, assasinate
sneak?

standard missions, teams
10 missions-20 missions, maps
find characters on missions, between civilians.

*************+
time slow mode
once per turn unit, allow whole team to react to enemy turn, once
passive - can move mid enemy turn, when enemy enters range
passive - if you can predict their move and you step behind them - backstab

this could make it 4 abilities... slow mode and normal.
and mixed classes
*****************

enemies could use civilians.
*********************
dark blood abilities and shiny cute ones.


29.07.2018
Playtesting level 4 - cityCenter
movement je boring, and too long - cut it? simplify it rpg-like

but combat isn't - this is good

z magi vse lahko clearaš - MR, prediction

uniti imajo samo 1 kombinacijo
včasih imaš občutek da bi hotel še 1 attack več, npr move+attack+invis
but not attack attack invis
the go in and out is good, you figure out the restrictions... but it feels like
assasin should be able to move and attack and then disengage

maybe add a dash. but the fact is that it can be solved with planning. that's the
kind of char it is. high risk, low options.
or cutthroat instakill passive, to take full effect of invisibility + prediction
but only twice per mission
replaced by backstab or dash after

mages higher range


there is only 1 possible playstyle per character formation.
and it's completly dependent on their skills.

option 1: passive

option 2: flip mode - a different casting mode
this would give them a different set of skills, specialized for different situation
essentially give a different playstyle, different character in mission.

this would mean we need to design differnt situations.

how about always have the same core identity for the character, but different skills.

each character can be used for 2 playstyles, primary, 
is the identity, secondary, is specialization

and it was immersive... you could see each character's role in the team. 
It was visible playing in the head, how the interactions should go
but you wish it could be more. that it could do a little more. 
that you could use it a bit differently.
that's good.
i could give that through quest.
or just provide it.
the fact is however, this team, provides this style.
pick a different team if you want different style.
it's slightly simplistic.
****
make the enemies like a puzzle? dodging could achieve that.
certain slots, dodge in certain direction, when seeing the prediction shot.
field of vision.


******************
normal playstyle
instant attack

prediction playstyle
reaction shot - predict the enemy move
snipe

nuke playstyle
aoe

tank playstyle
block
parry

non-agressive playstyle
talk
charm aura

surviviability playstyle
heal
parry

support playstyle
aura
buff

assasinate playstyle
cutthroat

delayed playstyle
charge attack

life and death playstyle

movement playstyle
dash
phase

******************

tank+predictor = use shield to predict how attacks will come. 
correctly predicted chain will be blocked. after mistakes you still get some damage.

****
i think i should add prediction shots
it will be really interesting to know how to bait the enemy, into assasin backstab...
and it will add the complexity to learn their behaviour over repeating.
you will notice the pattern.

instead of increasing range, you could make it an optionally casting shot
when not casted, just a simple cleanup shot
