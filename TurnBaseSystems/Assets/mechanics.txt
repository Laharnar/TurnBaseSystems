ABILITY SYSTEM
1) select unit - ability wheel
2) select unit - menu - select ability
3) number system
4) Hunter x hunter weapon based. - sonny
animations and area of damage.
5) Envrounmental, like wind to makes dust, instead of tornado.
Scenes:
fantasy magic
scifi move

Chargers, charge internal magic into density based effects, like explosions, or lighting.
Consumers, Drainers. Healer that drains external energy for different effect, like heal, drain.
Ying-jang, same thing
Atom controllers, aclhemists. Produce matter on atom level, changes or moves atomic structure. Can create atomic bomb, waves, earthquakes or change material, potions. Extremly unstable and difficult to control.

Users. Instead of making stuff, they use whatever is at their disposal. It's members are usually smart and creative, with many combat options.
Detach controllers. Same as builders, but reverse. Same thing.

Tech. uses electronic components.
I don't like destroyers. It's kinda boring class. What do they do? Destroy. Better.
Consumers do the same job, detach energy stuff.

Energy users and matter users.
Collectors, Consumers, Builders, Users.

Energy system tells us what the character uses to create his abilities
Matter system tells us how he utilizes that in combat. What's his preference.

Or 2 separate system, to make 4 combinations and 4 specialists

Dead people can be used as weapons.

SHOOTING
first have gun equipped. Then press on enemy unit to shot at. then aim cone shows
hitting the line shot at enemy will do damage.(you can also make it a cone instead of line,
to hit for more damage).
Cover will reduce avaliable hit area, making it harder to hit.

BUILDER building
how about rotatable mask based build
optionally based on gathered material?

** COLLECTOR SKILLS **

ENHANCE: Enhances equipped item for few turns.
Weapon type defines effect change
Door: survivabilty against bullets
gun: insanity bullet - collector's aura gets mixed in opponets aura, which makes them lose control - reduce will?, maxmoves for n turns
stick: it becomes hard like steel which allows our soldiers to hit harder. increased damage.

Another interesting options is to to pass an enhanced item to unit with more actions, or deeper in area.
Ability counter is reduced on end of every turn, when on 0, it reverts to default weapon.


Additional: enemies cannot use enhanced weapons.

** VISION **
Let's try to devote 1 week to drawing and looking at art.
Find what sticks, try different stuff.
I would like something dark, like spies, plus agent's of shield or xcom mission vibe 
and hunterxhunter vibe freestyle combat vibe. I want a subtle touch of sci-fi cult.
maybe sonny or psycho-pass, epic battle fantasy for magic.
optionally with a touch of fun fantasy humor, maybe some slimes or something

What about the story? Setting? Military.
Rebels.
THE QUEEN CITY. Ye this one is top shit. FUCK U ALL. I'M TIRED OF YOUR SHIT.
GO FIGHT. THE WINNER BECOMES THE KING.
this has the best option on city. Craizy, like lol. dynamic. Fairy tail. FMA.
Fairy tail+ military dark magic = fma
epic battle fantasy+psycho pass = parasyte?
or re:zero/green banana guy

fma, hxh, code:geass

dynamic dark.

which one?
straight
over the top

colorful to colorless?
maybe drain abilities create a decolor effect on camera.

something with many people's focus,.

galactic? that's too big

this could be game 2, with contracts.
i should focus on the small game.
how about galactic special ops? mass effect
plus robots, and mechanical

hints; other worlds, galaxy. the world is wast and rich.
rich.

.
Alien area.
agents with powers
superheroes - no
spies
magic and soldiers
magic monsters
sci-fi
spaceships
knights
vampires
freestyle fantasy

**

** story **
exploration
faction/gang battles
ai
calm factions with big events happening in the city to gain influence to fight
in the queen's games.
respond on which events you go
spy through
converse ability

more of a combatless social tactical turn based?
** world building way **
core player with supporting team.
with minimal faction contact.

** team **
can be hired from other factions. requires high enough influence.
mafia, burners gang, bikers, monsters, techies, ai, militia, magis, plus police and queen.
teachers, scientists, kids

** events **
assasionation of empress
assasination of gank leader.
guy picking off enemies.
sent to prison.

looking for inspectors at posts
dont talk to someone and they die, let them live on for a whle
rings
treason
unknown darkness that offers power - the outsider
a careful father and his sons - the makuta
essence
fighting groups
these revenge guys who "survived throuhg the worst"... those don't brag about it.

** map **
faction areas
those open up into faction combat area.
you can perform operations to attack factions for stuff.
if you stay stealthed you don't lose influence with them. 

optional spies or police.

event areas - open up over days, multiple even choces in multiple areas.
those open up in combat area.
when near an enemy, enter combat mode.
like your team groups up in a circle, and then fans out, still in cover.
entering fight, triggers civilians to fight too.

optional - resource focus. it earns you influence with some factions and loses it with others.
you can gain equipment, or magic stuff
loyalty - additionaly overrides the faction influence. you can do loyalty missions.
loyal soldiers don't leave you over low faction influence.

** factions **
They are sorted by recognition.


**
Start coming up with characters, with factions.
merchants, pirates, spartans, royalists, empress, gladiators, pyromancers, witches, 
elf, military, mafia, bandits, clerics
character:
2 core skills
class or specialization

Build a team - 4 people? 3? what would be the right balance?
3 is a little low for missions. depending on difficulty.
is the team core constant? 1 leading person?
or a core as a faction?
faction leader?
how about solo mission start plus deployment points?

core unit categories
in-stealth combatant
frontline
backline
optional a 1 specialist - the special fun

the flavor
enhancer
healer
distruptor
drainer
builder
charmer
multibullet
knife combatant
tactical strikes
infiltrator

core gameplay tactics
melle combat
mid range
long range
preparations - casting

military general or soldier, 
tactical factory robot or drone from factoy - guns and tactical laser orbital strike

aoe heal, shadow mist, shaman summon undead, call airstrike, call orbital cannon, machine gun
which is the lead? standard melle? conversionalist? eh just make the team. and how it will feel


this robot... they should have their own mind their goal. not just help, cuz why not.
different races have different values.
traitors tho
workout stuff in spaceships

Stupid robot puppies.
lmao he's "afraid" of the gun. don't give me that crap. and hurting doesn't mean disabling.

Game idea:
Fix the spaceship that was attacked. Defend against the aliens and retake the station.
The human relationship in a survirous of space crashes are interesting


*************
bad stuff
loyalty skill can be used only on the factions area - tactical progression, <no it enforces faction 
choice over free faction choice>, backstabbing(reinforces faction)
loyalty is calculates as sum of work the unit did. hard to grasp. removes the simple logic

Goal : a slightly story based game focused on characters and factions
A set of 3 skills plus  a loyalty skill and a team specific skills
loyalty it reinforce the team and the bond with specific faction.
you need to work for it it get's easier if you work for it << a new way to combine with your mates
you don't need to use it tho, it doesn't make game any easier

or it opens a new possibilty in the level for that unit - their core ability
hugely reinforces the characters

how about forcing the loyalty if you want some missions. that way you work for it AND you get 
rewarded, as part of progression

some require more loyalty? or require additional missions
reinforces faction types

*characters and factions*

goals to work towards factions - maybe cover the area?
or raise points on buildings / checkpoints
plus the global area to belong to certain faction when you win

buildings - reinforce your character's faction
objective - reinforces global goal as per quest - this is how you get teammates
end level, what to do with objective?

movement - a sense of progress through level - fight enemies

bait the enemy
zig zag over level - after defeating enemies in close area

familiarity field on units - after being in area for a while recieve a slight bonus.
reinforce factions
reinforce knowledge of units
so do enemies

to have and achieve goals
work for goals


tactics - use each character for it's goal


1 on 1 dangerous combat, supporting fast 1 shot strikes
4 on 1, 4 on 2?
1 on 3?

straight in?
easy survive?

just normal combat
surprise attacks? < long range channel attacks out of vision
hidden
