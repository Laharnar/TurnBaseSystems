Add walls. Like a building.

Soo. I have a few ways to do this. Full slot walls. Thin walls.
Full slot walls will make climbing easy too.

How do I want to build level? Place stuff. Then apply items.

Maybe grid detects which slot are taken ?
-- all raycasting + components.


Abilities are active depending on the slot, the area around it.
- ui system that allows you to show new items. 
One way is to just show the abilities, above items.
Another is to show them in drop down menu.
- load items based on parameters scanned from slot.
- somehow mark objects in area, and make them avaliable to scan - per range per ability

Ok I got abilities of slots. Or parameters.
Now these things have to be loaded on grid - ok, so they can be accesed from ui controller - ok.
The items have to be activated to show UI when player selects unit. -ok 1
ui has to be constructed by hand, or just enabled piece by piece. -ok
ui pieces have to moved so they don't cover each other. Do this LATER! -ok ish
works for now. should be redone to be more robust.
ui shuold be visible only in interaction range.
