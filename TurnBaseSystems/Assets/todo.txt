Add walls. Like a building.

Soo. I have a few ways to do this. Full slot walls. Thin walls.
Full slot walls will make climbing easy too.

How do I want to build level? Place stuff. Then apply items.

Maybe grid detects which slot are taken ?
-- all raycasting + components.

ABILITY SYSTEM
1) select unit - ability wheel
2) select unit - menu - select ability
3) number system
4) Hunter x hunter weapon based. - sonny
animations and area of damage.
5) Envrounmental, like wind to makes dust, instead of tornado.
Scenes:
fantasy magic
scifi move

Chargers, charge internal magic into density based effects, like explosions, or lighting.
Consumers, Drainers. Healer that drains external energy for different effect, like heal, drain.
Atom controllers, aclhemists. Produce effects on atom level, changes or moves atomic structure. Can create atomic bomb, waves, earthquakes or change material, potions. Extremly unstable and difficult to control.

Dead people can be used as weapons.

Abilities are active depending on the slot, the area around it.
- ui system that allows you to show new items. 
One way is to just show the abilities, above items.
Another is to show them in drop down menu.
- load items based on parameters scanned from slot.
- somehow mark objects in area, and make them avaliable to scan - per range per ability

Ok I got abilities of slots. Or parameters.
Now these things have to be loaded on grid - ok, so they can be accesed from ui controller - ok.
The items have to be activated to show UI when player selects unit. -ok 1
ui has to be constructed by hand, or just enabled piece by piece. -ok
ui pieces have to moved so they don't cover each other. Do this LATER! -ok ish
works for now. should be redone to be more robust.
