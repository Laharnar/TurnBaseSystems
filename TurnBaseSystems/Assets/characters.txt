-----------------------------
the charging aoe caster
identity - max 1 attack per turn with possible aoe effect, high damage, preparation and timing - reinforces idea of a strong backline caster, an inner consumer

instead of randomization, use stack based
rain attack - explosive - random in area, by number of charges
laser attack - send and return - charges allow piercing and range, killed units heal 1 and return charges

self destruct
randomized attack area(10) - risky last resort option, no charges, a bunch of functions
required, lose 90% current hp, 10 random shots
charge passive - random 1-2, or moved/not moved, max 5, auto return damage when attacked by melle, and has charges

-rain attack
high dmg
collected attack, use aoe to consume charges

energy = 6
aoe
range 1 self
randomization pattern

press slot, on hit, repeatedly extend shot range in direction from source, up to 
number of charges
e = 6

-self destruct
e=10
collected attack, charges = all
