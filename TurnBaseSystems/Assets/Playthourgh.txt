----------------------- 3.9.2018 playthrough 1
had a lot of them earlier, just didn't record...

Notes:
priest aoe should nuke em, and attacks don't work
Holy judgement - places a bunch of things that explode

surround was okay
zombies are a okay
dogs on ending were okay.
more dmg on zombies?

only 1 attack
long shot stronger

disable collision on units.
heal could be stronger

moving and failing to move, increases movement.
ranges, are melee

swap units automatically..
captains with bugs are tuff, 5 units, 5 turns
but it was fun
still no one died cuz they shield mine
dogs could do more dmg

i don't need all the units

2 dekurions, 2 dogs wave is borng
8 dekurions don't really need to do much

taunt on the melle guy

full shield penetration
aura disability

it gets grindy after that.
they don't have enough dmg to be scary.
aoe would be better as explosion
was better as small explosion.

always slash twice
this is good.
1 dog
easy.
anticipation

Length:
1400/60 mins
=140/6 = 24mins
maybe place slot that explodes?

Satistfaction: 2.8f/5
Meh it wasn't bad. only 1 moment like that. but it wasn't great.
or that engaging.

Rating: - 

Fixes required:
Priest/Holy judgement : more specilized, like nuking skill. aoe doesn't really fit.
more moves on melee gurads
Long shot should be stronger for 1 use only.
Raycasting on units shouldn't work.
Stronger heal, or move empower
swap units automatically..
2 dekurions, 2 dogs wave is boring
Aura bugs.
drop bugs.
allies as enemies.
taunt or parry on enhancer guy
full shield penetration or aura disability. too bugged.

Improvement:
lacking specialization. on enforcer and priest. absolete armor(range buff?). 
weak skills longshot.
heal up or mobility empower
lacking mobility on enemies.
enforcer: taunt or parry. be tanky, glow, frontliner. cant both move and attack.
priest: full shield penetration debuff or aura disability. 
mage: high dmg
infested: infestation shot - poison. change them into indiscriminating zombies.


Wave balance:
last 2 dekurions 2 dogs split into 3 is boring. running over map is boring.
allies should be enemies
last big wave is grindy due to unit balance.

Bugs:
raycasting on units
auras
spawn items
weird move glitches.
enemy unit move all at same time for some reason, plus banned insta skipped.

Options:
swap units automatically, or trigger which are avaliable.

there is a sligh problem with dealing with a lot of tanky units with meoderate dmg
not tanky enough

healing could add a buff that additionally heals by 1... so priest can use aoe more often not so boring
