pitch 1:
create a foothold for a sci-fi colony in a different world, with a team of highly specialized people.
interactions with people and new civilizations. survival.

pitch 1.1:
sci-fi colonists thrown into fantasy world to colonize.

okey that's the hook. the sci-fi. the fantasy. coming together. others can come too.
can be silly. funny sometimes. fun. but serious.
doesn't take itself seriously but it does.
it always was i loved it.
the inn was from different perspective... of an insider observing the sci fi coming in.

okey
let the colonists go through basic training, against known alien species.
then send them off.
and the find a slime
flip out
go full defensive
stabiliz

wide and deep
expand wide and dig a little. then expand de depth until you hit a wall.

pitch 2.1:
fight other scientist to become the best in the field.
could be funny, but personal touch.
ridiculous - throwing potions.
memorable

pitch 2:
expand your faction in the city, to become top member
meh... lacks in imagination. predictable. fight other factions.
turn based combat.
boring predictable story...

pitch 3:
create a team and fight to become a king.
okey, this could be interesting.. how to create teams, how to fight.
turn based combat. uhh fight in the shadows, raid places
static personality
ninja ish
could lead to a nice one time story.
could be tragic

pitch 4:
fight in a training simulation to prepare for deployment
kinda cheap...
some growing could be forced?

hxh:
kid is looking for his famous dad, a legenary hunter. some ppl join him in their own quests.
someone to look up to, looking for worth and awesomeness thourh fights.
build and grow and improve.

lol:
fight in a team of 5 v 5 in a fantasy world of runeterra. with unique champions.
stagnant. static. focused on champ dynamic.

dawn of tomorrow:
a soldier get's stuck in a time loop fighting aliens.
turn based combat.
meeting new ppl, exploring time ideas, training, and ultimately winning at a cost. limited.
